  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had formulated a good knowledge of CSS and HTML. I had finished blogging many weeks ago about my journey through computing throughout the year. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start the summer term with a fresh blog, at the very least working, but hopefully with some colour and edits to make it more of my personal blog. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did mostly reach my target, however, I do feel like I could have pushed myself further to get a really good start. After being told to create a new blog, I looked at the one the teacher recommended which was “Minimal mistakes.” I decided to fork it.

After doing some edits here and there to make sure it was working fine, I looked at my empty blog. I decided it needed some personalising. I added a link to my github page, some personal details (name, description, etc) and added a blue and white colour system. However, I think I could have smoothened up the colours.

I posted my blog on my google classroom, and began writing this blog! </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Self belief and perseverance really helped me to start off well. I pushed through while making my blog. After that, when I was struggling to get it working, I started to think flexibly. This flexible thinking allowed me to try different techniques to help me and aided me to get my blog up and running. 

For the latter part of the lesson, logical thinking while looking through the code to make it my own blog, really helped. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I didn't take much responsible risks other than trying Minimal mistakes instead of the alternative. So, with my actual blog I could have tried something more difficult, for example an image background or cleaning up some more difficult parts to clean up. This would have improved my learning and make my blog far more better. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to always try and get out of my comfort zone and push myself. I will not be able to learn that much if I do not try and go further up. </td>

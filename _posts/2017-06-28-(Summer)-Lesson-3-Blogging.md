(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did reach my target, after struggling and numerous attempts.

I added an input command that asked for the username. If this was a correct username then it would ask for the password, if not it would say it was an incorrect username using “else” and “if.” Then if the password was correct it would give the information if not it would say that it was an incorrect password.</td>

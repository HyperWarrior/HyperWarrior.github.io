    <td>To create a username and password checker and improve on my blog if I have extra time.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did not reach my target, I really did struggle with the task. After I spent a few minutes checking on my blogs, I went on classroom.

I was struggling on how to start. As the teacher realised people were struggling, he got the people who were confused to the front. He went through the thought process we have to take through in computing. The lesson ended after this.

He told us to work for thirty minutes at home with this. At home, I was able to ask users for their username, and I attempted to take in the response and answer with whether it was in the database or not. However despite all my attempts it kept answering it was not in the database even if it was.

I asked a friend named Raif and he helped a lot. However, I was still unable to fully complete it, and was only able to verify the username and password by themselves and not together. </td>

    <td>I came to the teacher for help which definitely aided me and made me think about computing. I realised how it was very useful in real life. I decided to be resourceful and look at my past works with python and that helped to. Reaching out to a friend helped a lot, and I think next lesson I will hopefully be able to complete this task. </td>

    <td>I think I could have spent more time at home, possibly start fresh again on codecademy. I also need to think more logically and think firstly about what I am trying to achieve. Then I need to think about the methods to achieve this. </td>
